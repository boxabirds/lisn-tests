    <b>A new four-week lockdown has begun in England, with people told to stay at home and non-essential shops, pubs and gyms ordered to close.</b>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november">new rules</a> ban households from mixing indoors or in private gardens, unless in a support bubble.</p>
    <p>Shoppers in England flocked to stores to make <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54815677">last-minute purchases</a> on Wednesday, with some retailers <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54807255">extending their opening hours</a> to cope with the huge demand.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-54793959">Unlike the first lockdown in March</a>, schools, universities, and nurseries will remain open, and people will be able to meet another person who they do not live with in an outdoor public place such as a park or beach. </p>
    <p>Spokesman for the Wetherspoons chain took a grim view:</p>
    <blockquote>"It will be the end of retail in the UK"</blockquote>
